1. Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the  development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. In the tech industry software engineering enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.

2. Milestones include the development of programming languages (e.g., Fortran, C), the establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s, the advent of structured programming in the 1970s, and the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.

3. Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
  - Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
  - Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.

4. - Waterfall: Sequential approach with distinct phases (e.g., requirements, design, implementation) flowing downwards like a waterfall. Suitable for places such as infrastructure projects i.e setting up server systems.
  - Agile: Iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change. Suitable for places such as software startups and in projects with evolving requirements such as app development.

5. Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
  - Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
  - Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

6. Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code (e.g. Visual Studio).
  - Version Control Systems (VCS): Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members (e.g., Git, Subversion).

7. Changing Requirements. - Implementing agile methodologies.
  - Tight Deadlines. - Regular reassessment of projects' goals and timelines.

8. Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
  - Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
  - System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
  - Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
  Testing helps to identify and fix defects early in the development process, leading to higher-quality software products.

  #Part 2

1. Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. It helps by making your questions clear and specific, so the AI understands exactly what you need.

2. Write about the importance of technology.
   Write a 500-word article on how technology has impacted the education sector, including examples of specific tools or software used for online learning.
   The improved prompt is more effective because it has a Specific Topic Scope and it requests for Concrete Examples.
